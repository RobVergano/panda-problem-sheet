# letter.py
# This program reads in a text file and outputs the number of eÂ´s (or other letter) it contains.

#Line 7 and 8 asks the user to input a text file and the letter wanted. 
#The assumption here is that the text file is in the same directory as letter.py, otherwise It must be specified.

#Line 11 defines the function.

    #Line 15 reads the content from the text file.

    #Line 17 returns the the number of times the specified value "b" appears in the text file.

#Line 22 outputs the number of times the specified letter appears in the text file. 
#Since the output of "textfile.count" is a numerical value we have to convert it into a string.
